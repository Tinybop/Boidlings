A mini-game demonstrating the use of applying simple physics to make your game dynamic and intriguing

WARNING: The included level editor (zipped) saves out sprite file references with the full path... So if you try and open level1.mbml it will just crash because it can't resolve the files. You need to manually fix this by editing the mbml file yourself (just once) and correcting the paths. Someday soon this will be fixed.
